# Top Test Pains

- "Skills Issue" 
    - just not up to speed on coding/.net, etc. is huge.
    - knowing testing tools (xUnit, MsTest, Etc)
    - Getting confused about difference between unit/system/system-integration etc.
        - Whatever you call these.
        - "shift left" - unit tests used to be what (maybe) developers do, now system tests, system integration tests, etc.
- "Flaky Tests" - pass sometimes, sometimes fail. "HeisenTests"
- "Slow Tests' - take forever to run.
- "Breaking unit tests with new features or refactors" - Tests as an obstacle 
- Dealing with backing services (dependencies) we don't own.
- Finding the correct level of testing/avoiding redundancy
- What else?
