# The Software Catalog

- Aligned with the "Software Control" business unit.

They want an HTTP API that:

Allows applications to discover what software is currently supported at "our company".

Any employee can access the catalog.

They can search software by:
- vendor
- application
- version

"Do you support Microsoft Excel 2017?"

Members of the SoftwareControl team can add new items to the catalog.

Items have -
- Vendor
- Application
- Version
- Commercial or FOSS
    - If it is commercial, the annual projected cost per seat.
    - The Sub of the SoftwareControl person that added it, and the date and time it was added.

(When we share this data, just share the vendor, the application, the version, and if it is a commercial, the cost,
The Sub and datetime it was created is for internal use only)




(Some software can have multiple supported versions)

Each is assigned an ID used for internal tracking.
